Fix for the `DOMNodeInserted` deprecation warning:

    [Deprecation] Listener added for a synchronous 'DOMNodeInserted' DOM 
    Mutation Event. This event type is deprecated () and work is underway 
    to remove it from this browser. Usage of this event listener will cause 
    performance issues today, and represents a risk of future incompatibility. 
    Consider using MutationObserver instead.

The original developer seens to not be aware of this.

The only change was made update quill for a recent version.
